This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `reduce` method in Swift when used with empty arrays. The `reduce` method is a powerful tool for aggregating values in an array, but it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if not used correctly. The example shows how an empty array with a missing initial value or an inappropriate combining operation can cause compile-time or runtime errors. The solution shows how to handle empty arrays and ensure type safety when using `reduce`.
